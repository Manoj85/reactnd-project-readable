# Readable

Readable project is a content and comment web app. 
Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. 
Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

## Installation

To get started developing right away:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
    
    The api will run locally on *port: 3001* or simply
    Open http://localhost:3001 in a your browser
        
* In another terminal window, use Create React App to scaffold out the front-end
    - `cd readable`
    - `yarn start` OR `npm start`
    
    The api will run locally on *port: 3000* or simply
